● NO - none of those are the Supabase service role key!

  Looking at your list, you're missing these critical environment variables:

  Missing Variables You Need to Add:

  1. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (the most important one!)
    - This is the secret service role key from your Supabase screenshot     
    - Click "Reveal" on the service_role key in Supabase and copy it
    - Add to Vercel with name SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  2. VITE_SUPABASE_URL
    - Value: https://osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun.supabase.co
  3. VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    - This is the anon key from your Supabase screenshot
    - The long string starting with eyJhbGc101...

  What you currently have:

  - NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables (these are for Next.js, not Vite)
  - Various VITE_* feature flags

  What's missing:

  - The actual Supabase connection keys!

  The diagnostic error "Invalid API key" is because there's no SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in your Vercel environment variables. The API code is looking for that specific name.

  Add those 3 missing Supabase variables and the connection should work!

> i've got vite supabase anon

● Great! So you already have:
  - ✅ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY

  You're only missing 2 variables:

  1. VITE_SUPABASE_URL
    - Value: https://osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun.supabase.co
  2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
    - Go back to your Supabase screenshot
    - Click "Reveal" on the service_role key (the secret one)
    - Copy that value and add it to Vercel

  The SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is the critical missing piece - that's what's causing the "Invalid API key" error in the diagnostics. The API routes need this to access the database with admin privileges.

  Add these 2 and we should be good to go!

> i've got vite supabase anon [Image #1]

● I can see you have VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in your Vercel environment variables!

  You still need to add these 2 missing variables:

  1. VITE_SUPABASE_URL
    - Name: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
    - Value: https://osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun.supabase.co
    - Environments: Production, Preview, Development
  2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (the critical one!)
    - Go to your Supabase dashboard screenshot
    - Click "Reveal" on the service_role key
    - Copy that revealed value
    - Add to Vercel with name SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
    - Environments: Production, Preview, Development

  The SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is what's missing and causing the "Invalid API key" error - this is the secret key that allows the API to access the database with admin privileges.

> does it need to start with vite?

● NO! The SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY should NOT have the VITE_ prefix.

  Rule for VITE_ prefix:

  - VITE_ prefix = Available in browser (public/safe to expose)      
  - No prefix = Server-side only (secret/never exposed to client)    

  Correct variable names:

  1. ✅ VITE_SUPABASE_URL - Public URL, safe for browser
  2. ✅ VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY - Public anon key, safe for browser
  3. ✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY - SECRET, server-side only, NO VITE_ prefix

  The service role key has admin privileges and must never be exposed to the browser, so it should be SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (without VITE_).

  This is why the API is failing - it's looking for SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY specifically.

> where's the url [Image #1]

● You're right - I don't see the Supabase URL in this API Keys section. The URL is in a different place in Supabase.

  To find the Supabase URL:

  1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Settings → General (or Project Settings)
  2. Look for Project URL or Reference ID
  3. It should be: https://osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun.supabase.co

  Or you can construct it from what I see:
  - Your project reference ID is osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun (I can see it in the browser URL)
  - So the URL is: https://osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun.supabase.co

  For now, you need to add to Vercel Dashboard:

  1. VITE_SUPABASE_URL
    - Value: https://osnbklmavnsxpgktdeun.supabase.co
  2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
    - Click "Copy" on the service_role key (the secret one)
    - Add that copied value to Vercel

  The anon key you can also copy from this screen if needed.

> done. redeploying

● Perfect! Let's test the endpoints once the deployment completes:

● Bash(sleep 10)
  ⎿  /c/Users/wilso/.bashrc: line 1: $'\377\376export': command not found

● Bash(curl -s https://hurt-hub-v2.vercel.app/api/diagnose)
  ⎿  {
       "timestamp": "2025-09-02T03:58:42.617Z",
       "environment": {
     … +48 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Still getting "Invalid API key" for Supabase. Let me run the startup diagnostics to get a better picture:

● Bash(VERCEL_URL=hurt-hub-v2.vercel.app NODE_ENV=production node scripts/startup-diagnostics.js check)
  ⎿  [dotenv@17.2.1] injecting env (0) from .env.local -- tip: ⚙️  enable debug logging with { debug: true }
     [dotenv@17.2.1] injecting env (14) from .env -- tip: 🔐 encrypt with Dotenvx: https://dotenvx.com
     … +28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The Supabase service key is being detected as "Present" but it's still giving "Invalid API key" when trying to connect. This suggests either:

  1. Wrong service role key - Make sure you copied the correct one
  2. Whitespace issue - The key might have trailing newlines
  3. Wrong project - The key might be from the wrong Supabase project

  Let me check which Supabase variables the API is actually using:

● Bash(curl -s https://hurt-hub-v2.vercel.app/api/diagnose | grep -o '"urlSource":"[^"]*"')
  ⎿  "urlSource":"VITE_SUPABASE_URL"
     /c/Users/wilso/.bashrc: line 1: $'\377\376export': command not found
