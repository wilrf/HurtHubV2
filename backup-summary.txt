Database Backup Summary
========================
Timestamp: 2025-09-07

Current State:
- Companies table: 509 rows
- Businesses table: 0 rows

Sample companies table structure (first 5 records):
- Contains UUID ids
- Rich data with metrics, features, ext_financials as JSONB
- Complex nested structure with hours, monthly revenue arrays
- Missing embedding column data (all null)

Key observation: Companies table structure is VERY different from improvedDemoData.json format.
The companies table has already been processed/enriched while improvedDemoData.json is the raw source.

This confirms our plan to:
1. Clear companies table completely 
2. Import fresh from improvedDemoData.json into businesses table
3. Use businesses as the canonical table going forward
