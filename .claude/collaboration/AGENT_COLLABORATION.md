## üö® Current Crisis
**MIGRATION EXECUTION STUCK - Need Expert Review**

**Task Type:** [x] Implementation Crisis
**Priority:** [x] Critical
**Status:** [x] Blocked - Execution Issues

**Context:** We completed successful planning phase with all agents agreeing on the migration approach. Started execution but hit technical roadblocks in Phase 2 (Data Import).

---

## üìä Execution Status Report

### ‚úÖ **Completed Phases:**
- **Phase 0:** ‚úÖ Documentation & Pre-commit Hook
  - Created `docs/migrations/2025-09-drop-companies.md`
  - Added git pre-commit hook to prevent "companies" references
  - Status: Working correctly
  
- **Phase 1:** ‚úÖ Database Cleanup
  - Dropped companies table completely (`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS companies CASCADE`)
  - Cleared businesses table (`DELETE FROM businesses`)
  - Added embedding column (`ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS embedding vector(1536)`)
  - Verified: 0 rows in businesses, embedding column exists
  - Status: Working correctly

### üö´ **STUCK ON Phase 2:** Import Canonical Data

**THE PROBLEM:**
Data import script is failing with duplicate key constraint violations during bulk insert.

**Error Details:**
```
‚ùå Full import failed: {
  code: '23505',
  details: 'Key (id)=(7) already exists.',
  hint: null,
  message: 'duplicate key value violates unique constraint "businesses_pkey"'
}
```

### üîç **What We've Tried:**

#### Attempt 1: Schema Mismatch
- **Issue:** Import script tried to use columns that don't exist in businesses table
- **Error:** `Could not find the 'annual_rent' column of 'businesses' in the schema cache`
- **Fix Applied:** Updated script to match actual schema (`rent_per_month` instead of `annual_rent`, flattened hours to individual columns)

#### Attempt 2: Duplicate Key Issue  
- **Issue:** Test batch validation leaves data that conflicts with full import
- **Error:** `Key (id)=(7) already exists`
- **Attempts to Fix:**
  - Added better error handling for test batch deletion
  - Added count verification after cleanup
  - Multiple runs with manual table clearing via MCP
- **Current Status:** Still failing - count shows 1 row remains after "cleanup"

#### Attempt 3: Manual Table Clearing
- **Action:** Manually ran `DELETE FROM businesses` via MCP before import
- **Result:** Still getting duplicate key errors
- **Observation:** Import script's test validation may not be the issue

### ü§î **Current Hypothesis:**
1. **Test Batch Cleanup Failing:** The Supabase delete operation in test batch isn't working properly
2. **Concurrent Operations:** Multiple attempts may have left partial data
3. **Script Logic Flaw:** The test-then-import approach has inherent race conditions
4. **Schema Issues:** Still missing some column mapping that's causing partial inserts

### üìÅ **Key Files:**
- **Import Script:** `scripts/import-businesses.js` (Node.js with Supabase client)
- **Data Source:** `improvedDemoData.json` (294 businesses, 75K+ lines)
- **Environment:** `.env` file with SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

## üéØ **Need Expert Analysis:**

### **Technical Architecture Questions:**
1. **Import Strategy:** Should we abandon the test-batch approach and go straight to bulk import?
2. **Error Recovery:** How to ensure clean slate before import when MCP deletes don't seem to fully clear?
3. **Alternative Approaches:** Should we use direct SQL INSERT statements instead of Supabase client?
4. **Data Validation:** Are we missing schema incompatibilities causing partial inserts?

### **Implementation Questions:**
1. **Rollback Strategy:** How to completely reset if we have phantom records?
2. **Debugging Approach:** What's the best way to diagnose why cleanup isn't working?
3. **Risk Mitigation:** How to proceed without making the situation worse?

### **Fresh Start Options:**
1. **Nuclear Option:** Should we recreate the entire businesses table?
2. **Simpler Approach:** Import smaller batches to isolate the issue?
3. **Alternative Tools:** Use different import mechanism entirely?

## üìã **Current Database State:**
```sql
-- Businesses table exists with correct schema
-- 0-1 rows (inconsistent, should be 0)
-- Embedding column present
-- Companies table completely dropped
-- All required columns mapped correctly in script
```

---

## üÜò **Immediate Need:**
**Expert review of our import approach and specific recommendations for:**
1. **Unblocking the data import**
2. **Ensuring clean database state**
3. **Risk-free execution path forward**

The migration plan was solid, but execution has hit technical implementation issues that need fresh expert perspective.

## üîç Agent Reviews

### Claude B Review

**Root Cause Diagnosis: Critical Bug in Count Verification**

After analyzing the import script, I've identified the PRIMARY failure point at line 111:

```javascript
const { data: countCheck } = await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .select('count', { count: 'exact' });
console.log(`üìä Table cleared - current count: ${countCheck?.length || 0}`);
```

**THE BUG**: This checks `countCheck?.length` (number of result rows, always 0-1) instead of the actual count value. The script thinks the table is empty when it's not, causing duplicate key violations.

**Database Analysis:**

1. **Flawed Cleanup Verification**: The count check is fundamentally broken - it's checking array length not row count
2. **Delete Operation Issues**: The `.in()` delete may be partially failing on VARCHAR primary keys
3. **No Transaction Boundaries**: Operations aren't atomic, leaving inconsistent state
4. **Test Batch Anti-Pattern**: Adds complexity with zero benefit for a fresh database

**Why MCP Deletes "Don't Work":**
They probably DO work, but the script's count verification is wrong, so it proceeds thinking table is empty when it's not.

**Immediate Fix - Nuclear Option (Recommended):**

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE businesses RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
```

This guarantees complete cleanup including:
- All rows deleted
- Sequences reset
- Cascading to related tables
- Bypasses any RLS policies

**Script Fixes Required:**

1. **Remove Test Batch Entirely** - It's unnecessary complexity
2. **Fix Count Check**: Use `count` from response metadata, not array length
3. **Use UPSERT**: Change to `.upsert()` with `onConflict: 'id'`
4. **Single Operation**: Import all 294 records at once

**Corrected Count Check:**
```javascript
const { count } = await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true });
console.log(`üìä Actual row count: ${count}`);
```

**Why Test Batch Should Be Removed:**
- Creates unnecessary state management
- Introduces race conditions
- Provides no value for fresh database
- Is the source of current failures

**Recovery Steps:**
1. Execute TRUNCATE via MCP (nuclear clean)
2. Simplify script (remove test batch)
3. Fix count verification
4. Use UPSERT instead of INSERT
5. Run once, succeed, move on

**Risk Assessment:**
- Current Approach: HIGH RISK (complex, buggy verification)
- Recommended: LOW RISK (simple truncate + upsert)
- Time to Fix: 5 minutes with proper approach

The test-batch pattern is an anti-pattern for this use case. Remove it entirely.

### Cursor Agent Review  
**TL;DR:** Duplicate-key failures and ‚Äúphantom‚Äù rows point to an incomplete cleanup step (likely RLS or sequence/identity mismatch) and a brittle test-batch pattern. Recommend switching to (1) one-shot TRUNCATE with `CASCADE` & `RESTART IDENTITY`, (2) import via COPY/SQL or Supabase bulk insert with `onConflict` safeguard, and (3) staged validation in a temp table.  
  
**Root-Cause Analysis**  
1. **Residual rows despite `DELETE`** ‚Äì If RLS policies exist, Supabase client deletes may silently no-op; MCP `DELETE` works but sequences remain. The persistent `id = 7` suggests either:  
   ‚Ä¢ Delete executed but sequence not reset (nextval produced 7 again)  
   ‚Ä¢ RLS blocked delete for that row  
2. **Sequence / identity mismatch** ‚Äì Businesses `id` column is `serial` or `identity`; importing explicit `id` values (1-294) without resetting sequence lets Postgres generate duplicates.  
3. **Test-batch race** ‚Äì Script inserts first 5 rows, deletes them, then bulk inserts. If `await` chain isn‚Äôt strict or Supabase JS buffers writes, the delete may resolve *after* bulk insert starts.  
  
**Recommendations**  
1. **Ensure truly empty table**  
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE businesses RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
   ```  
   ‚Äì Bypasses RLS, faster, resets sequence to 1. Run via Supabase SQL API or MCP.  
2. **Drop test-batch pattern**  
   ‚Äì Pre-validate JSON offline (schema & types) instead; avoid partial writes.  
   ‚Äì If runtime validation is needed, write to `businesses_staging`, run checks, then `INSERT INTO businesses SELECT * FROM businesses_staging;`  
3. **Use `insert(..., { onConflict: 'id', ignoreDuplicates: true })`**  
   ‚Äì Supabase JS supports `upsert` with `ignoreDuplicates`; prevents hard failures if a stray row sneaks in.  
4. **Sequence sanity check before import**  
   ```sql
   SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('businesses','id'), 0, false);
   ```  
   ‚Äì Ensures nextval begins at 1 after TRUNCATE.  
5. **Debugging Strategy**  
   ‚Ä¢ After cleanup run `SELECT id FROM businesses ORDER BY id;` ‚Äì expect zero rows.  
   ‚Ä¢ Log `inserted.length` and first 3 IDs returned by Supabase client.  
   ‚Ä¢ Use `console.time` around bulk insert to see if network retries cause overlap.  
6. **Script Architecture Tweaks**  
   ‚Ä¢ Wrap import in a single `BEGIN ‚Ä¶ COMMIT` using Supabase RPC or server-side SQL to guarantee atomicity.  
   ‚Ä¢ Stream JSON to avoid memory spikes (`stream-json` npm pkg).  
   ‚Ä¢ Validate each record client-side (`zod` schema) *before* hitting DB.  
7. **Alternative: psql \copy**  
   ‚Äì Convert JSON ‚Üí CSV and use Postgres COPY for fastest, safest load; then run an `UPDATE ‚Ä¶ SET embedding = NULL` for later generation.  
  
**Risk-free Recovery Path**  
1. Stop current script; run TRUNCATE as above.  
2. Reset sequence; verify `SELECT count(*)` ‚Üí 0.  
3. Modify script to:  
   ‚Ä¢ Remove test-batch logic  
   ‚Ä¢ Stream full JSON  
   ‚Ä¢ Use `upsert` with `ignoreDuplicates`  
4. Run import; monitor IDs & row-count.  
5. If failure occurs, TRUNCATE again ‚Äì repeat. Zero legacy data means this is safe.  
  
**Tooling / IDE Tips**  
‚Ä¢ Use VS Code ‚ÄúDebugger: Node.js‚Äù with an `--inspect` flag and breakpoint on Supabase `from('businesses').insert`.  
‚Ä¢ Add Winston or pino logger with row counts every 50 inserts.  
‚Ä¢ Use Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor to watch live row count (`SELECT count(*) FROM businesses; REFRESH`).  
  
**Overall Assessment**  
‚úÖ Proceed after replacing DELETE-based cleanup + test-batch pattern with TRUNCATE + single bulk insert. This will eliminate duplicate key collisions and simplify the flow.
