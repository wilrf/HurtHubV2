### Overall Progress: 0% [⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜]

### Architecture Transformation:
```
CURRENT: UI → API → Supabase (direct) → Database
TARGET:  UI → API → Service → Repository → Domain → Database
```

## 📋 Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Domain & Repository Layer (Agent 1 - 45 mins)
- [ ] Create Business domain entity with fromDatabase() transformation
- [ ] Create IBusinessRepository interface
- [ ] Implement SupabaseBusinessRepository
- [ ] Delete BusinessAdapter (wrong pattern)
- [ ] Define proper domain model

### Phase 2: Service Layer (Agent 2 - 45 mins)
- [ ] Create BusinessService with business logic
- [ ] Update BusinessIntelligenceService to use repository
- [ ] Create AIBusinessService for AI-specific logic
- [ ] Move all business logic from APIs to services
- [ ] Implement dependency injection

### Phase 3: API Layer Cleanup (Agent 3 - 30 mins)
- [ ] Update all 9 API endpoints to use services
- [ ] Remove ALL direct Supabase queries
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (let bubble)
- [ ] Ensure APIs are thin controllers only
- [ ] Verify no business logic in APIs

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (30 mins)
- [ ] Run full TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Test repository → service → API flow
- [ ] Verify domain entity transformations
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel preview
- [ ] Test all endpoints with proper architecture

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns
2. ✅ **Repository Pattern** - All data access through repositories
3. ✅ **Domain Entities** - Business logic in domain model
4. ✅ **Service Layer** - Business logic centralized
5. ✅ **No Direct DB Access** - APIs use services only
6. ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript compliance
7. ✅ **Testable** - Can mock repositories and services

## 🚨 Critical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Repository Pattern** - All data access through interfaces
2. **Domain Entities** - Business.fromDatabase() transformations
3. **Service Layer** - All business logic in services
4. **No BusinessAdapter** - Proper domain entities instead
5. **Sequential Execution** - Each layer depends on previous
6. **Clean Architecture** - UI → API → Service → Repository → DB

---

## 📊 Integration Points

### Shared Dependencies:
- All agents use `SHARED_REFERENCE.md` for field mappings
- BusinessAdapter (Agent 1) used by Agent 2 & 3 if needed
- No circular dependencies between agents

### Potential Conflicts:
- None identified - each agent owns separate files

---

## 🔄 Communication Protocol

### For Agents:
1. Update your status in EXECUTION_LOG.md when starting a file
2. Report completion of each file
3. Flag any blockers immediately
4. Run type-check after each file completion

### For Orchestrator:
1. Monitor EXECUTION_LOG.md for progress
2. Resolve any blockers
3. Coordinate final integration
4. Manage deployment
