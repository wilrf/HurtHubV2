## 📝 Notes Section

*Add any important observations or decisions made during execution*

- Architecture redesign: Moving from direct DB access to proper repository pattern
- Sequential execution required: Each layer depends on the previous
- Domain entities will handle all data transformations
- Services will contain ALL business logic
- APIs will be thin HTTP controllers only
